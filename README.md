# Integrating Large Language Models and Diffusion Models in Learning Analytics: A Speech-Driven Assistant

This work-in-progress research study introduces a novel application that combines large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to revolutionize learning analytics through an interactive, speech-driven or speech-assistant platform. The proposed system integrates a conversational agent powered by ChatGPT XL for speech-to-speech interactions and utilizes diffusion models for generating realistic text-to-image visuals. By merging verbal and visual learning aids, the system aims to enhance user understanding and engagement. Furthermore, our comparative results demonstrate that while ChatGPT XL generates fictional or stylized images, on the other
side, diffusion models excel in producing photorealistic visuals, which proves their utility and importance in educational contexts.


## Results

Figures 1 and 2, highlight the distinct capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT XL and diffusion models for a text-to-image generation.
